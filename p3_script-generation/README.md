# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree - Project 3: TV Script Generation
RNN TV script generation model with LSTM and Word2Vec components. Project 3 of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree
Original repository: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation

### Introduction
In this project, you willll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
