# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree - Project 4: Face Generation
Human face generation with DC-GAN architecture and Celebra dataset. Project 4 of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree
Original repository: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-face-generation

### Introduction
In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Your goal is to get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
