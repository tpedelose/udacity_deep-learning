# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree - Project 1: Bikesharing
Bike-sharing regression model.  Project 1 for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree
Original repository: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-bikesharing

### Introduction
In this project, you will build your first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. We've provided some of the code, but left the implementation of the neural network up to you (for the most part). After you've submitted this project, feel free to explore the data and the model more
